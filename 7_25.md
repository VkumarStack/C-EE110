## The Central Limit Theorem
- Under very general conditions, the distribution of the sum of random variables will approach the normal distribution as the number of variables become large 
    - This means that the sum of random variables can be modeled without knowing their marginal distributions, joint distributions, etc.
## The Normal (Gaussian) Distribution
- $f_X(x) = ke^{-cx^2}$
    - $f_X(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma_X \sqrt{2 \pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x- \mu_X}{\sigma_X})^2}$
- The Standard Normal Distribution has a $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$
    - Standard Normal PDF: $f_U(u)=\phi(u)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}}e^{-0.5u^2}$
    - Standard Normal CDF: $F_U(u)=\Phi(u)=\int_{-\infty}^u \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}}e^{-0.5x^2}dx$
        - This is symmetric, so $\Phi(-u)= 1 - \Phi(u)$
- For a Non-Standard Normal Random Variable, the z-score can be calculated
    - $U=\frac{X-\mu_X}{\sigma_X}$
## Sums of Normal Random Variables
- A linear combination of jointly normal random variables has a normal distribution
- If $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ have a joint normal distribution, then:
    - $Y = a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i X_i = a_0 + a_1X_1 +a_2X_2 + ... + a_n X_n$
    - Y has a normal distribution with mean and variance:
        - $\mu_Y = a_0 + \sum_{i = 1}^{n}a_i \mu_{X_i}$
        - $\sigma_Y^2 = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\sum_{j = 1}^{n}a_i a_j \sigma_{X_i} \sigma_{X_j} \rho_{X_i X_j}$
            - Recall that $\rho$ is the correlation coefficient
            - If the $X_i$'s are independent, then $\rho = 0$ so 
                - $\sigma_Y ^2 = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_i^2 \sigma_{X_i}^2$
## Approximating Sample Data
- Let $X_i$ be a set of independent and identically distributed random variables with mean $u_X$ and variance $\sigma_X^2$. Let $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ be $n$ independent observations from that random variable $X$
- The central limit theorem can be used to approximate the distribution of the sample mean:
    - $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$
    - $\frac{\bar{x} - \mu_X}{\frac{\sigma_X}{\sqrt{n}}}$ has approximately a standard normal distribution
