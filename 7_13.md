# July 13th Lecture
## Probability versus Statistics
- Statistics can be calculated using observations of past events to create models for random or uncertain variables - such as PMFs, PDFs, and CDFs
- These models can then be used to predict future events
## Graphical Displays
- The **histogram** is a simple graphical plot that illustrates the distribution of data
    - The heights (and areas) of the bars are proportional to the number of observations in a given interval ("bin")
    - Histograms provide an immediate impression of the most frequently occurring values and the range of the data
    - A good rule of thumb for the number of bins to use in a histogram is:
        - $n_{bins}=1 + 3.3\log_{10}(n_{observations})$
- A **frequency distribution** can be obtained  by dividing each histogram y-coordinate by the tottal number of data entries
    - $y_i=\frac{observations \; in \; bin \; i}{total \; observations}$
- An **empirical CDF** can be acquired by computing
    - $y_i = \frac{number \; observations \; \leq x}{total \; observations}$
    - This is advantageous over using a histogram or frequency distribution as there is no need to worry about bins
## Numerical Summaries
### Central Values
- $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i$
    - The mean of a set of empirical observations is different from the mean of a random variable; the empirical mean gives each observation the same weight (the same probability of occurence)
- The sample median is the middle value in an ordered data set
- The sample mode is the value occurring most often
### Variability
- $s^2_x=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2$
    - Here the $n - 1$ term is used instead of $n$ to remove bias
### Other Numerical Summaries
- These summaries are usually not necessary unless there is a large set of data
- Skewness: Sample Coefficient of Skewness
    - $m_3=\frac{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^3}{n-1}}{s^3}$
- Tail Heaviness: Sample Kurtosis
    - $m_4=\frac{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^4}{n-1}}{s^4}$
## Paired Datasets
- Sample Covariance:
    - $S_{X, Y}=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})$
- Sample Correlation Coefficient (Sample Covariance Divided by Product of Individual Variances):
    - $r_{X,Y}=\frac{S_{X,Y}}{S_X S_Y}$
## Matching Data to Probability Distributions
- The sample moments (mean, variance, etc.) can be equated to the moments of a random variable, known as the **method of moments**
    - The sample mean and sample variance is assumed to be the moments of the random variable being modeled
