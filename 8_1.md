## Extreme Value Distributions
- Consider independent, identically distributed (meaning they are sampled from the same random variable $X$) random variables $X_1, X_2, X_3, ..., X_n$. The extreme value distribution of these variables is given by:
    - $Y= \max{(X_1, X_2, X_3, ..., X_n)}$
    - $Y= \min{(X_1, X_2, X_3, ..., X_n)}$
- Maximum of Several Random Variables:
    - If $Y$ is less than some specified value $y$, then the random variables $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ must each individually be less than $y$
        - $F_Y(y)=P(X_1 < y \cap X_2 < y \cap ... \cap ... X_n < y)$
        - $F_Y(y)=P(X_1<y)P(X_2<y)...P(X_n<y)$ 
            - Follows from independence
        - $F_Y(y)=[F_X(y)]^n$
            - Since the random variables are all identically distribued from $X$, each probability $P(X_1<y)$ can be expressed as $F_X(y)$
    - PDF:
        - $f_X(y)=\frac{d}{dy}F_X(y)=n[F_X(y)]^{n-1}[f_X(y)]$
### Asymptotic Results
- As the number of random variables $n$ increases, the extreme outcomes of $\max{(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)}$ will lie farther out from the upper tail of $f_X(x)$
- This means that, for large $n$, the distribution of extreme values $(f_Y(y))$ is dependent only on the tail of $f_X(x)$
- **Type 1 Largest (Gumbel) Distribution**:
    - When $X$ extends to infinity and the upper (right) tail decays exponentially
        - $F_X(x)= 1 - e^{-a(x)}$ as $x \rightarrow \infty$
            - $a(x)$ is an increasing function of $x$
    - As the sample size $n \rightarrow \infty$, the distribution of $Y = \max{(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)}$ becomes:
        - $F_Y(y)=e^{-e^{-\alpha(y-u)}}$
        - $\alpha e^{\alpha (y - u) - e^{-\alpha(y-u)}}$
        - The parameters $\alpha$ and $u$ can be estimated if the mean and variance of $Y$ is known:
            - $\alpha = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{6}\sigma_Y}$
            - $u = \mu_Y - \frac{\gamma}{\alpha}$
                - $\gamma \approx 0.5772$
- To obtain the asymptotic distributions for $Y$, the mean and standard deviation of $Y$ must be determined in order to solve for $\alpha$ and $u$
- As $n$ increases, the asymptotic distribution approaches the exact distribution of $Y$
- **Type 1 Smallest Distribution**:
    - For a distribution with the lower (left) tail extending to negative infinity that decays exponentially, as $n \rightarrow \infty$, then CDF for $Y = \min(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)$ is:
        - $F_Y(y)=1 -e^{-e^{-\alpha(y-u)}}$
            - $\alpha = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{6}\sigma_Y}$
            - $u = \mu_Y + \frac{\gamma}{\alpha}$
                - $\gamma \approx 0.5772$
- **Type II Largest (Fisher-Tippett) Distribution**:
    - When the upper (right) tail of the underlying distribution extends to infinity and decays as a **power law** ($x^{-k}$)
    - As $n \rightarrow \infty$, the CDF for $Y = \max{(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)}$ becomes:
        - $F_Y(y)=(e^{(\frac{u}{y})^k})^n$
            - $\mu_Y=u \Gamma(1- \frac{1}{k})$
            - $\sigma_Y = u^2[\Gamma(1-\frac{2}{k}) - \Gamma^2(1-\frac{1}{k})]$
- **Type III Smallest (Weibull) Distribution**:
    - When the lower tail (left) of the underlying distribution is **bounded** and as $n \rightarrow \infty$, the CDF for $Y = \min{(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)}$ becomes:
        - $F_Y(y)= 1- e^{-(\frac{y}{u})^k}$
        - $f_Y(y)=\frac{ky^{k-1}}{u^k}e^{-(\frac{y}{u})^k}$
        - $\mu_Y=u\Gamma(1+\frac{1}{k})$
        - $\sigma_Y = u^2 [\Gamma(1 + \frac{2}{k}) - \Gamma^2(1+\frac{1}{k})]$
