- A **random variable** is a numerical variable whose specific value cannot be predicted with certainty before an experiment
    - A random variable takes on a numerical value for every possible event in the sample space
    - Examples:
        - *X* = The magnitude of a future earthquake
        - *Y* = The yield stress of a material
        - *Z* = The peak wind pressure during a given year
    - Random variables are denoted with an uppercase letters, and the values that they can take on are represented with the same letter but in lowercase
        - i.e. $P(X=x_1)$ is the probability that *X* is equal to some numerical value $x_1$
- If the number of values a random variable can take on are countable, the random variable is **discrete**
    - i.e. The number of cars on a bridge at any given time, the number of people in a classroom, etc.
    - The probability distribution for a discrete random variable can be quantified by a probability mass function (PMF)
        - $p_X(x)=P(X=x)$
        - Each value of $p_x$ must be greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to 1 (probability rules)
        - The sum of all values of $p_x$ must be equal to 1 (probability rules)
    - The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is defined as the probability that the random variable takes on a value less than or equal to the value of the argument
        - $F_X(x)=P(X\leq x)$
            - $F_X(-\infty)=0$
            - $F_X(\infty)=1$
            - $F_X(b) \geq F_x(a)$ if $b \geq a$
    - The probability mass function and the cumulative distribution function have a one-to-one relationship
        - $F_X(a)=\sum_{all \; x_i \leq a}p_x(x_i)$
- **Continuous** random variables can take on any value on the real axis
    - Since there are an infinite number of possible values, the probability of a random variable $X$ taking on a single value $x$ is zero
        - $P(X=x)=0=\frac{1}{\infty}$
    - The probability density function (PDF) is:
        - $f_x(x)dx=P(x < X \leq x +dx)$
        - ![Probability Density Function](./Images/Probability%20Density%20Function.jpg)
    - Since occurences in different intervals are mutually exclusive, the probability that the outcome of $X$ is between $a$ and $b$ can be found by integrating the probability density function over the interval of interest
        - $P(a<X\leq b)=\int_{a}^{b}f_X(x)dx$
    - A cumulative distribution function is defined as:
        - $F_X(x)=P(X \leq x)$
    - The probability density function and cumulative distribution function is defined as:
        - $F_X(x)=P(X \leq x)= \int_{-\infty}^{x}f_X(u)du$
        - $f_X(x)=\frac{d}{dx}F_X(x)$
    - Properties:
        - $f_X(x) \geq 0$
        - $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_X(x)dx=1$
        - $F_x(-\infty)=0$
        - $F_x(-\infty)=1$
        - $F_X(b) \geq F_x(a)$ if $b \geq a$
- Example: Find the PDF and CDF of the distance $R$ from a site to the epicenter of a future earthquake, which can occur randomly and with equal likelihood anywhere within a 100 km radius of a site
    - $R =$ distance to earthquake epicenter
    - ![Earthquake Example](./Images/Earthquake%20Example.jpg)
    - $CDF = F_R(r)=P(R \leq r) = \frac{area \; of \; circle \; with \; radius \; R}{area \; of \; circle \; with \; radius \; 100 \; km}$
        - $F_R(r)=\frac{\pi \cdot r^2}{\pi \cdot 100^2} = \frac{r^2}{10,000}$
    - $PDF = \frac{d}{dr}[F_R(r)] = \frac{r}{5000}$
    - $0 < R \leq 100 \; km$
